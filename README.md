# MadhavStore-Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard-PowerBI-main :- 
This project focused on analyzing and visualizing sales data for an e-commerce store called MadhavStore. I used Power BI to build an interactive dashboard that shows key business insights such as total sales, top-selling products, customer trends, and regional performance.

I cleaned and prepared the data using Power Query, created relationships between different tables, and added DAX formulas for custom calculations like profit margins and growth rates. The dashboard includes charts, filters, and KPIs to help understand sales performance and make better business decisions.

✅ Key Features:-

📊 Interactive dashboard showing total revenue, orders, and customer data.

🗂️ Product-wise and category-wise sales performance analysis.

🌍 Region-wise and monthly sales trends using maps and line charts.

🔎 Drill-down and filter options for detailed insights.

🧮 Used DAX for custom measures like profit, percentage change, and rank.
